        <p>My love, I know I’ve hurt you more times than I ever should have, and for that, I’m deeply sorry. 
        You are everything to me—my sunshine, my laughter, the peace to my chaos. Every moment without you feels 
        like a chapter missing from the story of my life.</p>

        <p>I’ve made mistakes, but please believe me when I say I never meant to make you feel unloved or unimportant. 
        You are the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known, and I cherish every little thing about you—from your smile 
        to your spark, your moods, and even your silence. I miss it all.</p>

        <p>This website is my way of trying to express what my words couldn’t say in person. I want to remind you of 
        how deeply I love you, and how much I’m willing to fight for us. I’m not perfect, but my love for you is 
        unwavering and sincere.</p>

        <p>Please scroll through, see the moments we’ve captured, and feel the love I’ve poured into every page.
        I hope this brings even the smallest smile to your beautiful face.</p>
